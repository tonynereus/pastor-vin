                        David In The Spirit
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        David was a king of Israel and was also a prophet. The Spirit of the Lord God was upon him and he heard His word several times. He was one of the few prophets that saw Jesus Christ in the spirit realm during their lifetime.

                        <strong>1. The Spirit Of The Lord In The Old Testament (1Peter 1:9-12). </strong>
                        Very many prophets wished to see the salvation plan of God for man but were not privileged (Matt 13:17). All the prophets of the Lord in the Old Testament possessed the same Spirit of Christ as attested to by Apostle Peter. They prophesied by the same Spirit. Because the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (Rev 19:10). Hence, very few of the prophets really recognized or understand the mystery. Isaiah saw the Lord in the Spirit and his ministry was transformed. The Lord sent him, and he spoke more about Jesus Christ (Isa 6:1-8; 7:14).

                        You must encounter Jesus Christ here on earth in order to reign with Him eternally. If His Spirit is not in your life, you have no part in Him (Rom 8:9). Repent and accept Jesus Christ!

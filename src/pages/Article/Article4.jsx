                    <p>It is noteworthy that either by coincidence or accident, at least an African was part of the Cross. Jesus Christ was already sentenced to death, condemned like a criminal, and was being led to the place of execution.</p>
                    <p>Though strange and uncommon, maybe because He was weak from the beatings by Roman soldiers, He needed a Simon to help.</p>

                    <p>Previously, Simon Peter had vowed to die with Him and not deny Him. But later, “... when He was arrested, ... they all forsook Him and fled” (Mark 14:50).</p>

                    <p>Peter had said, “Although all shall be offended, yet will not I... if I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise” (Mark 14:29, 31).</p>

                    <p>Hence, it appeared Jesus Christ needed a Simon, and suddenly an African, Simon of Cyrene, appeared to replace Simon Peter when he was absent. This attests to the fact that “... known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the world” (Acts 15:18). God cannot be stranded.</p>

                    <p>Though some theologians argue Simon of Cyrene was a Jew of the dispersion, the Bible literally identifies him as Cyrenian — from North Africa, present-day Libya.</p>

                    <p>Jesus had earlier been in Africa. Egypt, where He was hidden from Herod, is in North Africa (Matthew 2:13–23). Patriarchs like Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph also tread African soil (Genesis 12:10; 13:1; 46:1–7). Moses lived and ministered in Africa. The Torah was given on Mount Sinai — in Africa (Exodus 19–31).</p>

                    <p>Simon of Cyrene's participation in bearing the Cross is deeply significant. He followed Jesus and was not ashamed to be publicly identified with Him (Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26; Romans 1:16). Though compelled, “all things work together for good to them that love God” (Romans 8:28). He carried the Cross and followed Jesus as one of His disciples (Matthew 10:38; Luke 9:23; 14:27).</p>

                    <p>My brothers and sisters, it is high time we embraced the Cross like Simon and declare like Apostle Paul: “... I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ” (Romans 1:16). Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 8:12; 12:46; 14:6).</p>

                    <p>The African gods our ancestors served have contributed to our problems today. Human sacrifice, money rituals — why would a god request body parts of a man to bless another, when Jesus has been sacrificed once and for all? (Hebrews 9:28; 10:10). Why don’t they request jollof rice or lizards instead?</p>

                    <p>Enough is enough! We need to turn to the true God who never accepts human sacrifice. Nigeria’s power sector still struggles, perhaps because it bears the symbol of Sango — the African god of thunder. Till today, the average Nigerian doesn’t enjoy stable electricity.</p>

                    <p>Repent and accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior this Easter season. Christianity and Judaism were never foreign to Africa — they have always been part of our history. Let us come together, celebrate Easter, and carry the Cross with a heart free from sin.</p>

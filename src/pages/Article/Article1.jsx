                        David the king of Israel as anointed after king Saul reigned for forty years. Only the likes of Solomon reigned for such years and few others. David did well and had good relationship with God all his days. He initiated special worship of Jehovah in Israel. During his reigns, there were no record of strange worship, everyone was enjoying the God of Abraham. He initiated the building of the Temple which was later built by Solomon his son. He served God and his people till death. God made an everlasting covenant with his house, which his children enjoyed after him (2Sam 7:4-12).

                        <strong>1. For David’s Sake. </strong> It is a great privilege for David for God establishing an everlasting covenant with him and his house. All these did not happen because he was a king, but because his heart was right with God and His will. He taught Solomon to follow after his footsteps in serving the Lord God alone, else he will be rejected (1Kgs 2:1-4; 1Chron 28:9-10). This same Solomon misbehaved, married strange women and God became angry with him. Several of his children after him disobeyed God and were punished. But God always temper justice with mercy for David’s sake.

                        <strong>2. Examples of Some Cases.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Solomon could reign throughout his days purposely because of David (1Kgs 11:31-35).</li>
                            <li>Abijam was a sinful king but reigned because of David (1Kgs 15:1-5).</li>
                            <li>
                                Hezekiah faced a threat of invasion in Jerusalem, the city of David. But because of David, God killed all his enemies. When he fell sick, and was told to prepare to set his house in order. God sent His prophet to him again at his request and reassured him of extra fifteen years. He told him that He will defend the city (2Kgs 19:34-35; 20:6; Isa 37:35).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                God gave David a city, named after him (2Sam 5:7, 9; 6:12, 16; 1Kgs 2:10; 15:8, 24; Lk 2:4, 11).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world was surnamed after David. Hence, his name was immortalized just as God gave him a great name (1Chron 17:8). What a great honor! (Matt 1:1; 20:30; 21:9, 15; 22:42; Mk 10:47).

                        Some polluted principles
                        - Sex is a means of self-expression.  <br />
                        - A person cannot be balanced if he she does not have sex. <br />
                        - Breast pains, abdominal aches and menstrual pains are due to abstinence from sex. <br />
                        - Sex is love – it is a lie. <br />
                        - If it feels good, then it is good. <br />
                        - The other word for sex is making love (it is a lie). If Christ commanded love, nothing is wrong in making love. <br />
                        - Sex enforces closer and better relationship. <br />
                        - When you don’t have sex, you will get weak or ill desired, just like food and water.  <br />
                        - Boys who are sexually inactive will experience stomach aches or pains due to accumulation of semen in the abdomen. <br />
